[#50503687_pgfId-1001583]##  

===== [#50503687_pgfId-1001584]##Status of Document

[#50503687_pgfId-1002118]##This document is the Final Release of the
Java _TM_ Authorization Contract for Containers Version 1.5
specification and represents the definition of this technology as
implemented by the reference implementation (RI) and verified by the
technology compatibility kit (TCK) . This specification was developed
under the Java Community Process (JCP2.7).

===== [#50503687_pgfId-1001360]##Audience

[#50503687_pgfId-1001361]##This document is intended for developers of
the RI and TCK and for those who will be delivering implementations of
this technology in their products.

===== [#50503687_pgfId-1000712]##Abstract

[#50503687_pgfId-1000713]##This specification defines new
java.security.Permission classes to satisfy the Java EE authorization
model. The specification defines the binding of container access
decisions to operations on instances of these permission classes. The
specification defines the semantics of policy providers that employ the
new permission classes to address the authorization requirements of Java
EE, including the following:

* [#50503687_pgfId-1000714]##the definition of roles as named
collections of permissions
* [#50503687_pgfId-1000715]##the granting to principals of permissions
corresponding to roles
* [#50503687_pgfId-1000716]##the determination of whether a principal
has been granted the permissions of a role (e.g. isCallerInRole)
* [#50503687_pgfId-1000717]##the definition of identifier to role
mappings that bind application embedded identifiers to application
scoped role names.

[#50503687_pgfId-1000718]##The specification defines the installation
and configuration of authorization providers for use by containers. The
specification defines the interfaces that a provider must make available
to allow container deployment tools to create and manage permission
collections corresponding to roles.

===== [#50503687_pgfId-1000719]##Keywords

[#50503687_pgfId-1000710]##The keywords “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”,
“SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and
“OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in
RFC2119 [KEYWORDS].

===== [#50503687_pgfId-999982]##Acknowledgements

[#50503687_pgfId-999983]##This draft of the specification incorporates
the contributions of the RI and TCK teams with the output of the JSR115
Expert Group. The JSR 115 Expert Group included the following members:

[#50503681_pgfId-1001112]##Overview

[#50503681_pgfId-1002411]##This specification defines a contract between
Java EE containers and authorization policy modules such that container
authorization functionality can be provided as appropriate to suit the
operational environment.

===== [#50503681_pgfId-1002109]##Introduction

[#50503681_pgfId-1002435]##The contract defined by this specification is
divided into three subcontracts. Taken together, these subcontracts
describe the installation and configuration of authorization providers
such that they will be used by containers in performing their access
decisions. The three subcontracts are the
link:jacc.htm#50503686_23033[See Provider Configuration Subcontract],
the link:jacc.htm#50503688_29806[See Policy Configuration Subcontract],
and the link:jacc.htm#50503692_66195[See Policy Decision and Enforcement
Subcontract].

===== [#50503681_pgfId-1000018]##[#50503681_98813]##Assumptions

[#50503681_pgfId-1003266]##The contract defined in this JSR must be
applicable to both J2EE 1.3 platforms and J2EE 1.4 platforms and to
future versions of the Java EE platform.

[#50503681_pgfId-1003280]##We are defining a contract to be satisfied by
“standard” Java SE Policy providers. In a J2EE 1.3 context we expect the
provider to include a JAAS Policy provider.

[#50503681_pgfId-1003281]##J2EE 1.4 platforms will be required to
implement the contract defined by this JSR. This contract will be a
required element of subsequent versions of the Java EE platform.

[#50503681_pgfId-1002750]##Support for the contract by J2EE 1.3
platforms is optional. It is expected that there may be aspects of the
contract that are Java EE release specific.

[#50503681_pgfId-1001792]##We do not expect to add new decision
interfaces to Policy (JAAS or Java SE) to accomplish the work of this
JSR.

[#50503681_pgfId-1000020]##Java EE application roles will be modeled as
collections of permissions that are granted to principals.

[#50503681_pgfId-1000021]##A principal that is in a role is granted all
the permissions of the collection. However, the converse is not true.
That is, a principal that has been granted all the permissions of a role
is not necessarily in the role (as determined by isCallerInRole()).

[#50503681_pgfId-1000022]##This contract will shift the responsibility
for performing all of the authorization decisions pertaining to a Java
EE application to the policy provider. Accordingly, the following
mappings will become the responsibility of the provider.

* [#50503681_pgfId-1000023]##permissions to roles
* [#50503681_pgfId-1001147]##principals to roles
* [#50503681_pgfId-1001150]##(Application embedded) role references to
role names

[#50503681_pgfId-1002882]##It is assumed that there are providers that
are unable to enumerate all the permissions that pertain to a
subject/protection domain before returning from Policy.getPermissions().

[#50503681_pgfId-1002883]##Any interfaces that this contract defines to
be used by containers and or container deployment tools to create policy
statements within a policy provider must be compatible with a
module-at-a- time application deployment mechanism.

[#50503681_pgfId-1001711]##Where the Enterprise JavaBeansTM (EJBTM) or
Java ServletTM specifications are incomplete or ambiguous in their
specification of authorization functionality, the contract defined in
this document may require additional semantics. Additional or clarifying
semantics will only be adopted by this specification based on their
acceptance by the spec lead and expert group of the corresponding
component specification.

[#50503681_pgfId-1001720]##The EJB policy decisions performed by
providers may require access to the arguments of the EJB invocation and
or (for entity beans) the container managed EJB instance state.

===== [#50503681_pgfId-1001676]##[#50503681_16140]##Requirements

[#50503681_pgfId-1002580]##This contract must support providers that are
unable to determine, before returning from Policy.getPermissions(), all
the permissions that pertain to a subject/protection domain.

[#50503681_pgfId-1000031]##Each Policy provider that satisfies this
contract must perform or delegate to another provider all the permission
evaluations requested via its interface in the JRE; not just those made
by the container to implement Java EE security functionality.

[#50503681_pgfId-1003701]##Each provider must export interfaces (defined
by this contract) for use by containers and or container deployment
tools to create policy statements within the policy store of the
provider. These interfaces must be used when an application or module is
deployed in a container.

[#50503681_pgfId-1003728]##Each provider must satisfy all of the
authorization requirements of the EJB and Servlet specifications
corresponding to the target platform. The provider is not required to
satisfy the authorization requirements pertaining to any of the above
specifications for which the target platform is not a compatible
implementation.

[#50503681_pgfId-1003729]##The evaluation of a permission corresponding
to a resource must identify the context of the resource's use such that
different policy can be applied to a resource used in different contexts
(that is, applications or instances of an application).

[#50503681_pgfId-1000035]##In the case of Servlet resources, the
provider must be able to associate a distinct policy context with each
context root (including context roots created to support virtual
hosting) hosted by the server.

[#50503681_pgfId-1002888]##In protecting Servlet resources, a provider
must select the policy statements that apply to a request according to
the constraint matching and servlet mapping rules defined by the Servlet
specification.

[#50503681_pgfId-1002889]##To support this contract in a Servlet
environment, a container or its deployment tools must create policy
statements as necessary to support Servlet’s “default role-ref
semantic”.

[#50503681_pgfId-1003016]##For a container to support this contract, it
must execute in an environment controlled by a Java SE SecurityManager.
Containers may also execute in environments that are not controlled by a
Java SE SecurityManager. link:jacc.htm#50503681_79540[See Running
Without a SecurityManager] defines changes to this contract that apply
to containers running without a Java SE SecurityManager.

[#50503681_pgfId-1002960]##Policy providers must perform the permission
evaluations corresponding to container pre-dispatch decisions and
application embedded privilege tests (i.e isUserInRole and
isCallerInRole) without requiring that containers establish particular
values for any of the non-principal attributes of the one or more
java.security.ProtectionDomain objects that are the subject of the
evaluation.

======= [#50503681_pgfId-1001782]##Non Requirements

[#50503681_pgfId-1001784]##This JSR does not require that containers
support server-side authentication module plug-ins for the purpose of
populating subjects with authorization provider specific principals.

[#50503681_pgfId-1000043]##This JSR does not require that subjects be
attributed with role principals as a result of authentication.

[#50503681_pgfId-1002574]##This JSR does not define or mandate a
specific policy language to be used by providers. Each provider must
define its own syntax, mechanisms, and administrative interfaces for
granting permissions to principals.

[#50503681_pgfId-1000045]##The JSR does not require that providers
support a policy syntax for granting to principals roles as collections
of permissions.

[#50503681_pgfId-1000046]##Although the JSR is focused on defining
permissions and policy for use by Java EE containers, we make no
restrictions on the use of this information by other containers or
applications, or on support by containers or providers of other
permissions or policy.

[#50503681_pgfId-1000047]##It is not the intent of this JSR to extend or
modify the Java EE authorization model to be equivalent to standard RBAC
models for access control.

===== [#50503681_pgfId-1003117]##[#50503681_79540]## Running Without a SecurityManager

[#50503681_pgfId-1003118]##The following list defines changes to this
contract that apply to containers running without a Java SE
SecurityManager.

[#50503681_pgfId-1003122]##The restrictions defined in
link:jacc.htm#50503688_58139[See Permission to Configure Policy] need
not be enforced. Also, the containers of the application server must not
be denied permission to perform any operation that would have been
permitted in the presence of a SecurityManager.

[#50503681_pgfId-1003126]##Such containers are not required (before
dispatching a call) to associate an AccessControlContext with the call
thread (as otherwise required by link:jacc.htm#50503692_64165[See
Pre-dispatch Decision] and link:jacc.htm#50503692_62140[See EJB

Independent Grants] and in link:jacc.htm#50503692_72233[See Checking the
Caller for a Permission], such containers must not employ the
SecurityManager.checkPermission techniques defined in these sections.

[#50503681_pgfId-1003965]##When using the
AccessController.checkPermission technique of
link:jacc.htm#50503692_72233[See Checking the Caller for a Permission],
the calling container must ensure that the principals of the caller are
contained in the AccessControlContext associated with the thread on
which the call to checkPermission is made.

Configuration Subcontract] defines the requirements placed on providers
and containers such that Policy providers may be integrated with

===== [#50503686_pgfId-1003629]##[#50503686_26492]##Policy Implementation Class

[#50503686_pgfId-1009792]##The contract defined by this specification
has been designed to work in J2SE 1.4 or later Java Standard Edition
environments with the default _java.security.Policy_ implementation
class, and in J2SE 1.3 environments with the default
_javax.security.auth.Policy_ _implementation class. Support for the
contract defined by this specification is optional in J2EE 1.3
environments._

[#50503686_pgfId-1009269]##Java platforms provide standard security
properties whose values may be defined to cause replacement of the
default system Policy implementation classes. The security property, “
_policy.provider_ ”, may be used to replace the default
_java.security.Policy_ implementation class. Similarly, the security
property, " _auth.policy.provider_ ", may be used to replace the default
_javax.security.auth.Policy_ implementation class. These properties are
defined in the Java security properties file, and replacement is
accomplished by setting their value to the fully qualified name of the
desired Policy implementation class. The contract defined in this
specification, is dependent on the Policy replacement mechanisms of the
target Java environment. An application server that supports this
contract must allow replacement of the top level java.security.Policy
object used by every JRE of the containers of the application server.

===== [#50503686_pgfId-1006484]##Permission Implementation Classes

[#50503686_pgfId-1006485]##This contract defines a Java standard
extension package, j _avax.security.jacc,_ that contains (among other

decisions.

===== [#50503686_pgfId-1009619]##Policy Configuration Interface

[#50503686_pgfId-1009993]##The _javax.security.jacc_ package defines an
abstract factory class that implements a static method _that uses a
system property_ to find and instantiate a provider specific factory
implementation class. The abstract factory class is
_javax.security.jacc.PolicyConfigurationFactory_ , the static method is
_getPolicyConfigurationFactory,_ _and the system property is_
_javax.security.jacc.PolicyConfigurationFactory.provider_ .

[#50503686_pgfId-1013930]##The abstract factory class also defines an
abstract public method used to create or locate instances of the
provider specific class that implements the interface used to define
policy contexts within the associated Policy provider. The method is
_getPolicyConfiguration_ and the interface is
_javax.security.jacc.PolicyConfiguration_ .

[#50503686_pgfId-1013713]##This _javax.security.jacc_ package defines a
utility class that is used by containers to communicate policy context
identifiers to Policy providers. The utility class is
_javax.security.jacc.PolicyContext_ , and this class implements static
methods that are used to communicate policy relevant context values from
containers to Policy providers. Containers use the static method
_PolicyContext.setContextID_ to associate a policy context identifier
with a thread on which they are about to call a decision interface of a
Policy provider. Policy providers use the static method
_PolicyContext.getContextID_ to obtain the context identifier
established by a calling container. The role of policy context
identifiers in access decisions is described in
link:jacc.htm#50503688_39219[See Policy Contexts and Policy Context
Identifiers]”.

[#50503686_pgfId-1013734]##In addition to the methods used to
communicate policy context identifiers, the
_javax.security.jacc.PolicyContext_ class also provides static methods
that allow container specific context handlers that implement the
_javax.security.jacc.PolicyContextHandler_ interface to be registered
with the _PolicyContext_ class. The _PolicyContext_ class also provides
static methods that allow Policy providers to activate registered
handlers to obtain additional policy relevant context to apply in their
access decisions.

[#50503686_pgfId-1013825]##The _PolicyContext_ utility class and the
_PolicyContextHandler_ i _nterface_ are defined in

===== [#50503686_pgfId-1010078]##What a Provider Must Do

[#50503686_pgfId-1010077]##Each JRE of an application server must be
provided with classes that implement the _PolicyConfigurationFactory_
_class and_ _PolicyConfiguration_ _interface. These classes must be_
compatible with the Policy implementation class installed for use by the

implementation used by the JRE, no other components need be provided.

[#50503686_pgfId-1010116]##If the provider is seeking to replace the
Policy implementation used by the JRE, then the JRE must be provided
with an environment specific Policy implementation class. If the JRE is
running a J2SE 1.4 or later Java Standard Edition environment, then it
must be provided with an implementation of the _java.security.Policy_
class. If the JRE is running a J2SE 1.3 security environment, it must be
provided with an implementation of the _javax.security.auth.Policy_
class (that is, a JAAS Policy object).

[#50503686_pgfId-1010265]##A replacement Policy object must assume
responsibility for performing all policy decisions within the JRE in
which it is installed that are requested by way of the Policy interface
that it implements. A replacement Policy object may accomplish this by
delegating non- _javax.security.jacc_ policy decisions to the
corresponding default system Policy implementation class. A replacement
Policy object that relies in this way on the corresponding default
Policy implementation class must identify itself in its installation
instructions as a “delegating Policy provider”.

[#50503686_pgfId-1010217]##In J2SE 1.4, the subject based authorization
functionality of the JAAS Policy interface has been integrated into
_java.security.Policy_ , and the JAAS Policy interface (as a separate
entity) has been deprecated. This does not mean that the JAAS Policy
interface was removed, but rather that the essential parts of it have
been tightly integrated into the J2SE 1.4 platform.

[#50503686_pgfId-1013458]##According to this contract, a J2SE 1.4 or
later Java Standard Edition security environment may support replacement
of the JAAS Policy object if and only if all javax.security.jacc policy
decisions performed by the replacement JAAS Policy object return the
same result as when the java.security.Policy interface is used. To
satisfy this requirement, the replacement JAAS Policy object must be
compatible with the implementations of _PolicyConfigurationFactory_
_and_ _PolicyConfiguration_ _interface provided for use with the
java.security.Policy implementation class._

[#50503686_pgfId-1014198]##An application server or container must
bundle or install the _javax.security.jacc_ standard extension. This
package must include the abstract
_javax.security.jacc.PolicyConfigurationFactory_ class, the
_javax.security.jacc.PolicyConfiguration_ and
_javax.security.jacc.PolicyContextHandler_ interfaces, and
implementations of the _javax.security.jacc.PolicyContextException_
exception, _the javax.security.jacc_ Permission classes, and the
javax.security.jacc.PolicyContext utility class. The Permission classes
of the _javax.security.jacc_ package are:

* [#50503686_pgfId-1009656]## _javax.security.jacc.EJBMethodPermission_
* [#50503686_pgfId-1010159]## _javax.security.jacc.EJBRoleRefPermission_

_javax.security.jacc.WebUserDataPermission_

[#50503686_pgfId-1014485]##To enable delegation of non-
_javax.security.jacc_ policy decisions to default system Policy
providers, all application servers must implement the following Policy
replacement algorithm. The intent of the algorithm is to ensure that
Policy objects can capture the instance of the corresponding default
system Policy object during their integration into a container and such
that they may delegate non-container policy evaluations to it.

[#50503686_pgfId-1009605]##For each JRE of a J2EE 1.4 or later version
Java EE application server, if the system property
_“javax.security.jacc.policy.provider_ ” is defined, the application

_java.security.Policy,_ and set, by calling the
_java.security.Policy.setPolicy_ method, the resulting object as the
corresponding Policy object used by the JRE. For example:

[#50503686_pgfId-1014024]##An application server that chooses to support
this contract in a J2SE 1.3 environment must perform the policy
replacement algorithm described above when the system property “
_javax.security.jacc.auth.policy.provider_ ” is defined. That is, for
each JRE of the application server, the server must construct an
instance of the class identified by the system property, confirm that
the resulting object is an instance of _javax.security.auth.Policy,_ and
set, by calling _javax.security.auth.Policy.setPolicy_ method _,_ the
resulting object as the corresponding Policy object used by the JRE.

[#50503686_pgfId-1014030]##Once an application server has used either of
the system properties defined in this section to replace a Policy object
used by a JRE, the application server must not use setPolicy to replace
the corresponding Policy object of the running JRE again.

[#50503686_pgfId-1014028]##The requirements of this section have been
designed to ensure that containers support Policy replacment and to

[#50503686_pgfId-1010300]##The reference implementation of the combine
method of the JAAS _SubjectDomainCombiner_ returns protection domains
that are constructed with a _java.security.Permissions_ collection.This
is the norm in J2SE 1.3 environments, and it also occurs in J2SE 1.4 and
Java Standard Edition 5.0 environments when the installed JAAS Policy
implementation class is not the _com.sun.security.auth.PolicyFile_ class
(that is, the JRE is operating in backward compatibility mode with
respect to JAAS Policy replacement). The use of
_java.security.Permissions_ by the _SubjectDomainCombiner_ forces JAAS
Policy providers to compute all the permissions that pertain to a
subject and code source and effectively precludes integration of Policy
subsystems that are not capable of doing so. To ensure that the
implementation of the JAAS _SubjectDomainCombiner_ does not preclude
integration of a class of Policy providers, this contract imposes the
following requirement and recommendation on application servers.

[#50503686_pgfId-1010394]##To satisfy the contract defined by this
specification, a J2EE 1.3 application server must install or bundle,
such that it is used by every JRE of the application server, a
_javax.security.auth.SubjectDomainCombiner_ whose _combine_ method
returns protection domains constructed using the permission collections
returned by _javax.security.auth.Policy.getPermisions_ . It is
recommended that this requirement also be satisfied by J2EE 1.4 and
later version Java EE application servers in the case where
_javax.security.auth.Policy_ is used (in backward compatibility mode) to
perform javax.security.jacc policy decisions.

a platform is identical to that used to express policy in the deployment
descriptors. Where this is not the case, the output of the translation
must be equivalent to the translation that would occur if policy was
completely specified in the deployment descriptors and the translation
had proceeded directly from the deployment descriptors to the Java SE

excluded, and role permissions, and if all of the permissions of each
such collection are impliedlink:#pgfId-1027669[1] by the permissions of

[#50503688_pgfId-1022755]##It must be possible to define separate

policy statements (as defined by this specification) that effect access
to the resourceslink:#pgfId-1029722[2] in one or more deployed modules.
At policy configuration, a _PolicyConfiguration_ object is created for
each policy context, and populated with the policy statements
(represented by permission objects) corresponding to the context. Each
policy context has an associated policy context identifier.

[#50503688_pgfId-1015515]##In the link:jacc.htm#50503692_66195[See
Policy Decision and Enforcement Subcontract], access decisions are
performed by checking permissions that identify resources by name and

evaluation is to be performed (see link:jacc.htm#50503692_86918[See

only those defined in the context at the time of the call to refresh. A
policy context in the inService state must be unavailable for additional
configuration. A policy context in the inService state must be
transitioned to the open state when it is returned as a result of a call
to getPolicyConfiguration. A policy context is transitioned to the
inService state by calling the commit method, and only a policy context
in the open state may be transitioned to the inService state.

translation defined by this subcontract is described assuming that all

[#50503688_pgfId-1022379]##The URL pattern qualification described in
this section serves to capture the best-matching semantics of the
Servlet constraint model in the qualified names such that the
WebResourcePermission and WebUserDataPermission objects can be tested
using the standard Java SE permission evaluation logic.

[#50503688_pgfId-1024394]##The WebResourcePermission and
WebUserDataPermission objects resulting from the translation of a
Servlet deployment descriptor must be constructed with a name produced
by qualifying the URL pattern. The rules for qualifying a URL pattern
are dependent on the rules for determining if one URL pattern matches
another as defined in link:jacc.htm#50503688_31590[See Servlet
URL-Pattern Matching Rules]”, and are described as follows:

* [#50503688_pgfId-1022391]##If the pattern is a path prefix pattern, it
must be qualified by every path-prefix pattern in the deployment
descriptor matched by and different from the pattern being qualified.
The pattern must also be qualified by every exact pattern appearing in
the deployment descriptor that is matched by the pattern being
qualified.
* [#50503688_pgfId-1015128]##If the pattern is an extension pattern, it
must be qualified by every path-prefix pattern appearing in the
deployment descriptor and every exact pattern in the deployment
descriptor that is matched by the pattern being qualified.
* [#50503688_pgfId-1014928]##If the pattern is the default pattern, "/",
it must be qualified by every other pattern except the default pattern
appearing in the deployment descriptor.
* [#50503688_pgfId-1014935]##If the pattern is an exact pattern, its
qualified form must not contain any qualifying patterns.

[#50503688_pgfId-1014334]##URL patterns are qualified by appending to
their String representation, a colon separated representation of the
list of patterns that qualify the pattern. Duplicates must not be
included in the list of qualifying patterns, and any qualifying pattern
matched by another qualifying pattern maylink:#pgfId-1025035[8] be
dropped from the list.

======= [#50503688_pgfId-1024816]##QualifyingPatternList ::=

[#50503688_pgfId-1025090]## empty string | colon QualifyingPattern |

element in the QualifiedPattern.

[#50503688_pgfId-1027705]##Any pattern, qualified by a pattern that
matches it, is overridden and made irrelevant (in the translation) by
the qualifying pattern. Specifically, all extension patterns and the
default pattern are made irrelevant by the presence of the path prefix
pattern "/*" in a deployment descriptor. Patterns qualified by the "/*"
pattern violate the URLPatternSpec constraints of WebResourcePermission
and WebUserDataPermission names and must be rejected by the
corresponding permission constructors.

[#50503688_pgfId-1027730]##The section defines the rules for combining
HTTP method names occurring in _web-resource-collection_ elements that
apply to a common _url-pattern_ . The rules are commutative and
associative and are as follows:

* [#50503688_pgfId-1028345]##Lists of _http-method_ elements combine to
yield a list of _http-method_ elements containing the union (without
duplicates) of the _http-method_ elements that occur in the individual
lists.
* [#50503688_pgfId-1028636]##Lists of _http-method-omission_ elements
combine to yield a list containing only the _http-method-omission_
elements that occur in all of the individual lists (i.e., the
intersection).
* [#50503688_pgfId-1028637]##A list of _http-method-omission_ elements
combines with a list of _http-method_ elements to yield the list of
_http-method-omission_ elements minus any elements whose method name
occurs in the _http-method_ list.
* [#50503688_pgfId-1028638]##An empty list (of _http-method_ and
_http-method-omission_ elements) represents the set of all possible HTTP
methods, including when it results from combination according to the
rules described in this section. An empty list combines with any other
list to yield the empty list.

[#50503688_pgfId-1028366]##When these combining rules are applied to a
list of collections, the result is always either an empty list, a
non-empty list of _http-method_ elements, or a non-empty list of
_http-method-omission_ elements. When the result is an empty list, the
corresponding actions value is the null (or the empty string) value.
When the result is a non-empty list of _http-method_ elements the
corresponding actions value is a comma separated list of the HTTP method
names occurring in the _http-method_ elements of the list. When the
result is a non-empty list of _http-method-omission_ elements the
corresponding actions value is an HTTP method exception list (as defined
in link:jacc.htm#50503688_87961[See HTTP Method Exception
List]link:jacc.htm#50503688_87961[See HTTP Method Exception List]”)

[#50503692_pgfId-1010619]##A Policy provider must return that a tested
permission has not been granted if it acquires a non-null policy context
identifier by calling getContextID on the PolicyContext class and the
_inService_ method of the _PolicyConfigurationFactory_ associated with

identifier.

[#50503692_pgfId-1018714]##The default policy context contains the
policy statements that apply to the JRE independent of the policy
contexts defined as the result of the deployment of modules or
applications in containers. The policy context identifier of the default

linked to another PolicyConfiguration, and as such does not share the
principal-to-role mapping of any other policy context.

[#50503692_pgfId-1006410]##To be compatible with this contract, every
JRE of a J2EE 1.4 application server must perform all of the policy
decisions defined by this contract by interacting with the

===== [#50503692_pgfId-1018965]##[#50503692_33055]##Optimization of Permission Evaluations

[#50503692_pgfId-1019616]##Containers may employ the following
optimizations (based on reuse) when the result obtained by repeating the
evaluation will not differ from the previous result or when the time
since the previous evaluation is less than the container’s threshold for
being effected by policy changes:

* [#50503692_pgfId-1019623]##Containers may reuse an authorization
result obtained from a previous equivalent permission evaluation.
* [#50503692_pgfId-1019635]##Containers may reuse an authorization
result obtained for an unauthenticated caller (i.e. a caller with no
principals) performed as defined in link:jacc.htm#50503692_72233[See
Checking the Caller for a Permission]” to grant, independent of caller
identity, any permission implied by the unauthenticated result.

[#50503692_pgfId-1019602]##This specification does not prescribe how a
container determines when a repeated evaluation will return the same
result. That said, one way that containers could make this determination
is if they are, and can determine if they will be, notified of policy
changes and if they can establish that their policy provider does not
employ additional context (such as could be acquired by calling a
_PolicyContextHandler_ ) in its policy evaluations.

[#50503692_pgfId-1019681]##Common practice for containers to receive
such notification could be for them to register to the
_"java.security.Policy.supportsReuse"_ key a _PolicyContextHandler_ and
for the container to determine if its provider will notify it of policy
changes by making a test call to the provider’s _refresh_ method. Only a
provider that is compatible with the optimizations described above
(including because it does not employ additional context in its policy
evaluations) may deliver notice of policy changes by activating this
handler when its _refresh_ method is called.

======= [#pgfId-659204]##public interface _PolicyConfiguration_

===== [#pgfId-659206]##Description

[#pgfId-659208]##The methods of this interface are used by containers to
create policy statements in a Policy provider. An object that implements
the PolicyConfiguration interface provides the policy statement
configuration interface for a corresponding policy context within the
corresponding Policy provider.

[#pgfId-659210]##The life cycle of a policy context is defined by three
states; “open”, “inService”, and “deleted”. A policy context is in one
of these three states.

[#pgfId-659212]##A policy context in the “open” state is in the process
of being configured, and may be operated on by any of the methods of the
PolicyConfiguration interface. A policy context in the “open” state must
not be assimilated at _Policy.refresh_ into the policy statements used
by the Policy provider in performing its access decisions. In order for
the policy statements of a policy context to be assimilated by the
associated provider, the policy context must be in the “inService”
state. A policy context in the “open” state is transitioned to the
“inService” state by calling the commit method.

[#pgfId-659214]##A policy context in the “inService” state is available
for assimilation into the policy statements being used to perform access
decisions by the associated Policy provider. Providers assimilate policy
contexts containing policy statements when the refresh method of the
provider is called. When a provider’s refresh method is called, it must
assimilate only those policy contexts whose state is “inService” and it
must ensure that the policy statements put into service for each policy
context are only those defined in the context at the time of the call to
refresh. A policy context in the “inService” state is not available for
additional configuration and may be returned to the “open” state by
calling the getPolicyConfiguration method of the
PolicyConfigurationFactory.

[#pgfId-659216]##A policy context in the “deleted” state is neither
available for configuration, nor is it available for assimilation into
the Provider. A policy context whose state is “deleted” may be reclaimed
for subsequent processing by calling the getPolicyConfiguration method
of the associated PolicyConfigurationFactory. A “deleted” policy context
is transitioned to the “open” state when it it returned as a result of a
call to getPolicyConfiguration.

[#pgfId-659219]##The following table captures the correspondence between
the policy context life cycle and the methods of the PolicyConfiguration
interface. The rightmost 3 columns of the table correspond to the
PolicyConfiguration state identified at the head of the column. The
values in the cells of these columns indicate the next state resulting
from a call to the method identifed in the leftmost column of the
corresponding row, or that calling the method is unsupported in the
state represented by the column (in which case the state will remain
unchanged). +

===== [#pgfId-659878]##Description

[#pgfId-659880]##This utility class is used by containers to communicate
policy context identifiers and other policy relevant context to _Policy_
providers. _Policy_ providers use the policy context identifier to
select the subset of policy to apply in access decisions.

[#pgfId-659882]##The value of a policy context identifier is a _String_
and each thread has an independently established policy context
identifier. A container will establish the thread-scoped value of a
policy context identifier by calling the static _setContextID_ method.
The value of a thread-scoped policy context identifier is available (to
_Policy_ ) by calling the static _getContextID_ method.

[#pgfId-659884]##This class is also used by _Policy_ providers to
request additional thread-scoped policy relevant context objects from
the calling container. Containers register container-specific
_PolicyContext_ handlers using the static _registerHandler_ method.
Handler registration is scoped to the class, such that the same handler
registrations are active in all thread contexts. Containers may use the
static method _setHandlerData_ to establish a thread-scoped parameter
that will be passed to handlers when they are activated by _Policy_
providers. The static _getContext_ method is used to activate a handler
and obtain the corresponding context object.

[#pgfId-659886]##The static accessor functions provided by this class
allow per-thread policy context values to be established and
communicated independent of a common reference to a particular
PolicyContext instance.

[#pgfId-659888]##The PolicyContext class may encapsulate static
ThreadLocal instance variables to represent the policy context
identifier and handler data values.

[#pgfId-659890]##The Application server must bundle or install the
PolicyContext class, and the containers of the application server must
prevent the methods of the PolicyContext class from being called from
calling contexts that are not authorized to call these methods. With the
exception of the getContextID and GetHandlerKeys methods, containers
must restrict and afford access to the methods of the PolicyContext
class to calling contexts trusted by the container to perform container
access decisions. The PolicyContext class may satisfy this requirement
(on behalf of its container) by rejecting calls made from an
AccessControlContext that has not been granted the “setPolicy”
SecurityPermission, and by ensuring that Policy providers used to
perform container access decisions are granted the “setPolicy”
permission.

[#pgfId-660395]##public _WebResourcePermission_ ( _java.lang.String_
name, _java.lang.String_ actions)

[#pgfId-660397]##Creates a new WebResourcePermission with the specified
name and actions.

[#pgfId-660399]##The name contains a URLPatternSpec that identifies the
web resources to which the permissions applies. The syntax of a
URLPatternSpec is as follows:

[#pgfId-660401]## URLPatternList ::= URLPattern | URLPatternList colon
URLPattern

[#pgfId-660403]## 

[#pgfId-660405]## URLPatternSpec ::= null | URLPattern | URLPattern
colon URLPatternList

[#pgfId-660407]## 

[#pgfId-660409]##

[#pgfId-660411]##A null URLPatternSpec is translated to the default
URLPattern, “/”, by the permission constructor. The empty string is an
exact URLPattern, and may occur anywhere in a URLPatternSpec that an
exact URLPattern may occur. The first URLPattern in a URLPatternSpec may
be any of the pattern types, exact, path-prefix, extension, or default
as defined in the _Java Servlet Specification)_ . When a URLPatternSpec
includes a URLPatternList, the patterns of the URLPatternList identify
the resources to which the permission does NOT apply and depend on the
pattern type and value of the first pattern as follows:

* [#pgfId-660413]##No pattern may exist in the URLPatternList that
matches the first pattern.
* [#pgfId-660415]##If the first pattern is a path-prefix pattern, only
exact patterns matched by the first pattern and path-prefix patterns
matched by, but different from, the first pattern may occur in the
URLPatternList.
* [#pgfId-660417]##If the first pattern is an extension pattern, only
exact patterns that are matched by the first pattern and path-prefix
patterns may occur in the URLPatternList.
* [#pgfId-660419]##If the first pattern is the default pattern, “/”, any
pattern except the default pattern may occur in the URLPatternList.
* [#pgfId-660421]##If the first pattern is an exact pattern a
URLPatternList must not be present in the URLPatternSpec.

[#pgfId-660423]##The actions parameter contains a comma seperated list
of HTTP methods. The syntax of the actions parameter is defined as
follows:

[#pgfId-660425]## ExtensionMethod ::= any token as defined by RFC 2616

[#pgfId-660427]## (that is, 1*[any CHAR except CTLs or separators])

[#pgfId-660429]## 

[#pgfId-660431]## HTTPMethod ::= "GET" | "POST" | "PUT" | "DELETE" |
"HEAD" |

[#pgfId-660433]## "OPTIONS" | "TRACE" | ExtensionMethod

[#pgfId-660435]##

[#pgfId-660437]## HTTPMethodList ::= HTTPMethod | HTTPMethodList comma
HTTPMethod

[#pgfId-660439]##

[#pgfId-660441]## HTTPMethodExceptionList ::= exclaimationPoint
HTTPMethodList

[#pgfId-660443]##

[#pgfId-660445]## HTTPMethodSpec ::= null | HTTPMethodExceptionList |

[#pgfId-660447]## HTTPMethodList

[#pgfId-660449]## 

[#pgfId-660451]##

[#pgfId-660453]##If duplicates occur in the HTTPMethodSpec they must be
eliminated by the permission constructor.

[#pgfId-660455]##A null or empty string HTTPMethodSpec indicates that
the permission applies to all HTTP methods at the resources identified
by the URL pattern.

[#pgfId-660457]##If the HTTPMethodSpec contains an
HTTPMethodExceptionList (i.e., it begins with an exclaimationPoint), the
permission pertains to all methods except those occuring in the
exception list.

======= [#pgfId-660459]##Parameters:

[#pgfId-660461]## _name_ - the URLPatternSpec that identifies the
application specific web resources to which the permission pertains. All
URLPatterns in the URLPatternSpec are relative to the context path of
the deployed web application module, and the same URLPattern must not
occur more than once in a URLPatternSpec. A null URLPatternSpec is
translated to the default URLPattern, “/”, by the permission
constructor. All colons occuring within the URLPattern elements of the
URLPatternSpec must be represented in escaped encoding as defined in RFC
2396.

[#pgfId-660463]## _actions_ - identifies the HTTP methods to which the
permission pertains. If the value passed through this parameter is null
or the empty string, then the permission pertains to all the possible
HTTP methods.

[#pgfId-660475]##Creates a new WebResourcePermission with name
corresponding to the URLPatternSpec, and actions composed from the array
of HTTP methods.

======= [#pgfId-660477]##Parameters:

[#pgfId-660479]## _urlPatternSpec_ - the URLPatternSpec that identifies
the application specific web resources to which the permission pertains.
All URLPatterns in the URLPatternSpec are relative to the context path
of the deployed web application module, and the same URLPattern must not
occur more than once in a URLPatternSpec. A null URLPatternSpec is
translated to the default URLPattern, “/”, by the permission
constructor. All colons occuring within the URLPattern elements of the
URLPatternSpec must be represented in escaped encoding as defined in RFC
2396.

[#pgfId-660481]## _HTTPMethods_ - an array of strings each element of
which contains the value of an HTTP method. If the value passed through
this parameter is null or is an array with no elements, then the
permission pertains to all the possible HTTP methods.

======= [#pgfId-660489]##[#marker-660483]##[#MemberHead]##[#javax.security.jacc.WebResourcePermission.WebResourcePermission(javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest)]##WebResourcePermission( _javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest_ request)

[#pgfId-660491]##public _WebResourcePermission_ (
_javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest_ request)

[#pgfId-660493]##Creates a new WebResourcePermission from the
HttpServletRequest object.

======= [#pgfId-660495]##Parameters:

[#pgfId-660497]## _request_ - the HttpServletRequest object
corresponding to the Servlet operation to which the permission pertains.
The permission name is the substring of the requestURI
(HttpServletRequest.getRequestURI()) that begins after the contextPath
(HttpServletRequest.getContextPath()). When the substring operation
yields the string “/”, the permission is constructed with the empty
string as its name. The permission’s actions field is obtained from
HttpServletRequest.getMethod(). The constructor must transform all colon
characters occuring in the name to escaped encoding as defined in RFC
2396.

[#pgfId-660851]##public _WebUserDataPermission_ ( _java.lang.String_
name, _java.lang.String_ actions)

[#pgfId-660853]##Creates a new WebUserDataPermission with the specified
name and actions.

[#pgfId-660855]##The name contains a URLPatternSpec that identifies the
web resources to which the permissions applies. The syntax of a
URLPatternSpec is as follows:

[#pgfId-660857]## URLPatternList ::= URLPattern | URLPatternList colon
URLPattern

[#pgfId-660859]## 

[#pgfId-660861]## URLPatternSpec ::= null | URLPattern | URLPattern
colon URLPatternList

[#pgfId-660863]## 

[#pgfId-660865]##

[#pgfId-660867]##A null URLPatternSpec is translated to the default
URLPattern, “/”, by the permission constructor. The empty string is an
exact URLPattern, and may occur anywhere in a URLPatternSpec that an
exact URLPattern may occur. The first URLPattern in a URLPatternSpec may
be any of the pattern types, exact, path-prefix, extension, or default
as defined in the _Java Servlet Specification)_ . When a URLPatternSpec
includes a URLPatternList, the patterns of the URLPatternList identify
the resources to which the permission does NOT apply and depend on the
pattern type and value of the first pattern as follows:

* [#pgfId-660869]##No pattern may exist in the URLPatternList that
matches the first pattern.
* [#pgfId-660871]##If the first pattern is a path-prefix pattern, only
exact patterns matched by the first pattern and path-prefix patterns
matched by, but different from, the first pattern may occur in the
URLPatternList.
* [#pgfId-660873]##If the first pattern is an extension pattern, only
exact patterns that are matched by the first pattern and path-prefix
patterns may occur in the URLPatternList.
* [#pgfId-660875]##If the first pattern is the default pattern, “/”, any
pattern except the default pattern may occur in the URLPatternList.
* [#pgfId-660877]##If the first pattern is an exact pattern a
URLPatternList must not be present in the URLPatternSpec.

[#pgfId-660879]##The actions parameter contains a comma separated list
of HTTP methods that may be followed by a transportType separated from
the HTTP method by a colon.

permission pertains to all methods except those occuring in the
exception list.

[#pgfId-660925]##An actions string without a transportType is a
shorthand for a actions string with the value “NONE” as its
TransportType.

[#pgfId-660927]##A granted permission representing a transportType of
“NONE”, indicates that the associated resources may be accessed using
any conection type.

======= [#pgfId-660929]##Parameters:

[#pgfId-660931]## _name_ - the URLPatternSpec that identifies the
application specific web resources to which the permission pertains. All
URLPatterns in the URLPatternSpec are relative to the context path of
the deployed web application module, and the same URLPattern must not
occur more than once in a URLPatternSpec. A null URLPatternSpec is
translated to the default URLPattern, “/”, by the permission
constructor. All colons occuring within the URLPattern elements of the
URLPatternSpec must be represented in escaped encoding as defined in RFC
2396.

[#pgfId-660933]## _actions_ - identifies the HTTP methods and transport
type to which the permission pertains. If the value passed through this
parameter is null or the empty string, then the permission is
constructed with actions corresponding to all the possible HTTP methods

======= [#pgfId-660947]##Parameters:

[#pgfId-660949]## _urlPatternSpec_ - the URLPatternSpec that identifies
the application specific web resources to which the permission pertains.
All URLPatterns in the URLPatternSpec are relative to the context path

translated to the default URLPattern, “/”, by the permission
constructor. All colons occuring within the URLPattern elements of the
URLPatternSpec must be represented in escaped encoding as defined in RFC

[#pgfId-660951]## _HTTPMethods_ - an array of strings each element of
which contains the value of an HTTP method. If the value passed through
this parameter is null or is an array with no elements, then the
permission is constructed with actions corresponding to all the possible
HTTP methods.

[#pgfId-660953]## _transportType_ - a String whose value is a
transportType. If the value passed through this parameter is null, then
the permission is constructed with actions corresponding to
transportType “NONE”.

[#pgfId-660965]##Creates a new WebUserDataPermission from the
HttpServletRequest object.

======= [#pgfId-660967]##Parameters:

[#pgfId-660969]## _request_ - the HttpServletRequest object
corresponding to the Servlet operation to which the permission pertains.
The permission name is the substring of the requestURI
(HttpServletRequest.getRequestURI()) that begins after the contextPath
(HttpServletRequest.getContextPath()). When the substring operation
yields the string “/”, the permission is constructed with the empty
string as its name. The constructor must transform all colon characters
occuring in the name to escaped encoding as defined in RFC 2396. The
HTTP method component of the permission’s actions is as obtained from
HttpServletRequest.getMethod(). The TransportType component of the
permission’s actions is determined by calling
HttpServletRequest.isSecure().

noteworthy issues that have been discussed by the Expert Group. These
sections are included in the Final Release as they provide insight into
the discussions and decisions which shaped the form of the current
specification. All of these issues have been resolved, and their

====== [#50503690_pgfId-1012234]##Configuration Context and Policy Context Identifiers

[#50503690_pgfId-1011485]##The PolicyConfiguration interface associates
Configuration Context Identifiers with policy statements, which
themselves contain embedded policy context identifiers. There needs to
be more explanation of the purpose and use models of these context
identifiers. Configuration context identifiers should only be assigned
by the Provider, to eliminate problems with ambiguity. In the case of
createRole, we allow a configuration context identifier to be passed to
createRole so that one configuration context id can be used for all of
the roles in an application/module. It would probably be a good idea to
allow the unchecked and excluded policy collections to also share the
same context id. This would reduce the complexity of the identity
mapping, but it would make it harder for the provider to ensure
uniqueness of identifiers. We also want to support deployment and
undeployment of modules, within a multi-module policy configuration
context. That is, the modules share the same roles, but their individual
policy statements are differentiated by policy context id within these
roles.

[#50503690_pgfId-1011694]##

image:jacc-4.gif[image]

Regarding policy context identifiers, it will not be possible to
surgically replace the policy statements corresponding to a module, if
modules within a policy configuration context share the same policy
context identifiers.

image:jacc-4.gif[image]

[#50503690_pgfId-1011695]##

image:jacc-4.gif[image]

The PolicyConfiguration interface has been redesigned to support both
the factory and finder patterns, and to include an inService method to
allow a container to check if a PolicyConfiguration with a given
identifier already exists. The interface also includes the concept of
linked PolicyConfigurations to identify those PolicyConfigurations that
must share the same principal-to-role mappings.

[#50503690_pgfId-1011706]##The PolicyConfiguration interface is used to
communicate policy statements to Policy. An element of these statements
is a PermissionCollection that may contain EJBMethodPermission and
EJBRoleRefPermission objects that may have been constructed with
embedded references to argument arrays or EntityBean instances. The
contract must state whether such permissions may be passed through the
PolicyConfiguration interface, and what the responsibility of the
provider shall be should it occur.

[#50503690_pgfId-1011707]##

image:jacc-4.gif[image]

resolved via the introduction of PolicyContext handlers and the
corresponding removal of the ability to include such information in
permission constrictions.

====== [#50503690_pgfId-1011391]##Extensibility of the PolicyConfiguration Interface

[#50503690_pgfId-1011526]##For example, the PolicyConfiguration
interface does not include methods that may be used to interrogate
Policy to determine the list of configured policy configuration
contexts. We should also consider whether the interface should be
extended to support the configuration of additional forms (other than
unchecked, and excluded) logical policy statements

[#50503690_pgfId-1011559]##

getPolicyConfiguration, and the addition of the inService method to
PolicyConfigurationFactory.

We will not require that they be supported by policy providers, nor will
we require that policy providers reject other than the patterns defined
by servlet.

[#50503690_pgfId-1011634]##The PolicyConfiguration and Policy Decision
Subcontracts should be generalized to sustain evolution in the
declarative authorization policy representations used in deployment
descriptors. One dimension of this evolution, would be a change from
DTDs to schema.

[#50503690_pgfId-1012333]##

image:jacc-4.gif[image]

Some generalization in the PolicyConfiguration interface has occurred as
a result of the removal of policy context identifiers from permissions
such that any permission objects may be configured through this
interface.

====== [#50503690_pgfId-1011635]##[#50503690_46933]##Principals Passed to Providers in Subjects

[#50503690_pgfId-1011631]##The provider is expected to do
principal-to-role mapping, but we have not allowed the provider to
assume that it is working with a companion authentication module. We
have also not defined standard principals for containers to put in the
subjects used when they ask Policy to make decisions for them. So, it is
unclear how providers will be able to do Principal-to-Role mapping.

[#50503690_pgfId-1011867]##

image:jacc-4.gif[image]

We decoupled consideration of this issue from notions of principal
selection imposed by the getCallerPrincipal and getUserPrincipal methods
of EJB and Servlet respectively. We clarified that all principals in an
AccessControlContext shall be available to the policy module for use in
principal to role mapping. We added a requirement with respect to
asserting or vouching authorities to ensure that principals
corresponding to authorities are not misinterpreted by providers as
principals of the subject (see link:jacc.htm#50503692_72233[See Checking
the Caller for a Permission]). Moreover, we concluded that independent
of this contract, a policy module must be familiar with the principals
(i.e. security attributes) assigned to subjects as the result of
authentication in its operational environment and for which it must
evaluate policy.

[#50503690_pgfId-1012267]##When a container constructs an
EJBMethodPermission as part of its policy decision subcontract, it may
include a reference to the EJB (for an EntityBean) and the arguments to
the method in the constructed permission. Inclusion of this additional
context by containers is optional for performance reasons, yet it has
been suggested that the contract provide a way (perhaps via a callback
or an exception thrown by the provider) for the container to find out
whether or not such information would be used by the provider.

motivated by recurring requests to extend the Java EE “inRole” APIs to
allow multiple role references to be evaluated in a single call. The
permission classes noted above, currently support this functionality, at
the cost of having to span permissions in collection implication. The
most direct consequence of this spanning is that the new Permission
Collection methods of these Permission classes must not return null, as
they must return a PermissionCollection capable of doing the permission
specific spanning.

[#50503690_pgfId-1012107]##

image:jacc-4.gif[image]

The replacement paradigm has been changed such that it should no longer
be possible for providers to depend on custom implementations of the
permission classes defined by this specification. Accordingly, the
complexity introduced by spanning should be attenuated in the reference
implementation.

[#50503690_pgfId-1012019]##The desire for a single user interface for
security administration works somewhat counter to Java EE platforms that
provide their own administrative console for tasks like
principal-to-role mapping. That said, we need to preserve existing
platform administrative consoles by defining a method to integrate
provider specific principal-to-role mapping dialogs via the existing
platform consoles. We must ensure alignment with JSR 88, which is
solving a slightly different but overlapping problem. JSR 88 is defining
how a platform with fixed deployment interfaces can be integrated with
an administration console provided by another party.

[#50503690_pgfId-1012284]##

This is optional functionality. Providers may choose to provide a JSR 88
config bean that encapsulates a provider specific principal-to-role
management interface. Containers that wish to have tight integration
between their deployment consoles and a provider supplied
principal-to-role management interface, should pass the provider
supplied config bean among the config beans they are required by JSR 88
to return to a deployment tool.

[#50503690_pgfId-1012431]##Specification of the WebResourcePermission
and WebUserDataPermission classes with simple, single URL pattern names
is a bad fit for the Java SE Policy decision interface. The
implementation of getPermissions presents a major challenge, as the
constraint model would force the implementation to preserve ungranted
constraining permissions in the returned PermissionCollection. It also
would not be possible to implement the enumeration functionality
available through the elements method of the collection. Perhaps more
significant, the mapping of security constraints to simple, single URL
pattern names would require a special more complex Policy provider rule
combining algorithm, and as such, would render the default Java Policy
provider incompetent to process such permissions. The last point is in
direct conflict with a stated goal of the specification.

[#50503690_pgfId-1012562]##

image:jacc-4.gif[image]

The translation of web security constraints into Java SE permissions was
modified such that the URL pattern names of the WebResource and
WebUserData permissions include a representation of the URL patterns to
which the permission does NOTapply. The permission implies logic was
enhanced to take this change into account. As a result of these changes
these permissions may be processed by the default Java SE Policy module
like any other Java SE permission.

[#50503690_pgfId-1013367]##Servet 2.5 added support for HTTP extension
methods (as defined in IETF RFC 2616 "Hypertext Transfer Protocol --
HTTP/1.1") to security-constraints. Support for extension methods
requires changes to the WebResourcePermission and WebUserDataPermission
classes and to the translation of servlet security-constraints. In
general support for HTTP extension methods requires an ability to
represent non-enumerable HTTP method sets in the HTTPMethodSpec
components of WebResourcePermission and WebUserDataPermission actions
values.

[#50503690_pgfId-1013247]##

image:jacc-4.gif[image]

Modified the HTTPMethodSpec constructs of WebResourcePermission and
WebUserDataPermission to support an HTTPMethodExceptionList as a third
form of HTTPMethodSpec. This resolution is known to have the following
consequences with respect to backward compatibility: 1) A permission
constructed with an HTTPMethodSpec composed of an HTTPMethodList
containing all the "standard" HTTP methods (i.e.,
"DELETE,GET,HEAD,OPTIONS,POST,PUT,TRACE) is no longer equal to and no
longer implies a permission constructed with a null, empty array, or
emptyString HTTPMethodSpec. 2) Permissions constructed with a null,
empty array, or emptyString HTTPMethodSpec component to their actions
value represent the non-enumerable (due to extension methods) set of all
possible HTTP methods and are NOT equal to or implied by any permission
constructed with an HTTPMethodSpec represented as an HTTPMethodList. 3)
It is no longer possible to use the HTTPMethodList syntax to represent
(via enumeration) the complement of a proper subset of all HTTP methods.
As such, an HTTPMethodExceptionList must be used to represent any proper
subset of HTTP methods determined NOT to be constrained during the
translation of servlet security-constraints. 4) The use of exception
lists causes the permissions resulting from the translation of a given
security-constraint configuration to differ in their actions values from
those that would have been produced prior to support for HTTP extension
methods. Previously translated permissions remain supported by the
changed permission implementations, and (with the exceptions listed in 1
and 2 above) continue to function as they did before the change, as long
as extension methods are not set in checked permissions.

Servlet security-role-ref Elements] was modified to reflect the removal
of policy context identifiers from permission names.

[#50503685_pgfId-22059]##link:jacc.htm#50503688_44864[See Translating
EJB method-permission Elements] was made a subsection of a new
link:jacc.htm#50503688_72413[See Translating EJB Deployment Descriptors]
and changed to deal with the removal of policy context identifiers from
permission names.

[#50503685_pgfId-22102]##A new section link:jacc.htm#50503688_35482[See
EJB Policy Context Identifiers], was added to describe the selection of
EJB policy context identifiers.

[#50503685_pgfId-22121]##link:jacc.htm#50503688_44864[See Translating
EJB method-permission Elements], link:jacc.htm#50503688_91617[See
Translating the EJB exclude-list], and link:jacc.htm#50503688_74775[See
Translating EJB security-role-ref Elements] were all changed to reflect
the removal of the policy context identifier from permission names.

[#50503685_pgfId-22134]##link:jacc.htm#50503688_31592[See Undeploying an
Application or Module] was modified to reflect the use of the
PolicyContext class to define the policy context.

[#50503685_pgfId-22140]##link:jacc.htm#50503688_58139[See Permission to
Configure Policy] was changed to require that “the state of the policy
statement repository” not be changed when the caller does not have the
“setPolicy” permission. Also a new requirement was added that policy be
configured to grant containers the “getPolicy” and “setPolicy”
permissions.

======= [#50503685_pgfId-22128]##Changes to Policy Decision Subcontract

[#50503685_pgfId-22147]##The name was changed to the “Policy Decision
and Enforcement Contract”.

[#50503685_pgfId-22159]##link:jacc.htm#50503692_73550[See Evaluation of
Transport Guarantees], link:jacc.htm#50503692_64165[See Pre-dispatch
Decision], and link:jacc.htm#50503692_47050[See Application Embedded
Privilege Test] were changed to reflect the removal of the policy
context identifier from permission names.

[#50503685_pgfId-22154]##Section 4.2.1 “Servlet Constraint Matching
Semantics”, was replaced by two sections;
link:jacc.htm#50503692_26066[See Servlet Policy Decision Semantics], and
link:jacc.htm#50503692_37503[See WebResourcePermission Matching Rules].
The latter describes the processing of servlet constraints in a manner
related to the three types of policy statements created via the
PolicyConfiguration interface.

[#50503685_pgfId-22182]##Section 4.2.2.1, “Servlet URL-Pattern Matching
Rules” was renamed.

[#50503685_pgfId-22186]##Some changes were made to the last two tables
of Section 4.2.2.2, “Servlet Constraint Matching Examples” to
accommodate and better illustrate the OR constraint combining semantics.

[#50503685_pgfId-22190]##Section 4.2.3, “WebRoleRefPermission Processing
Semantics” was added as the public draft mistakenly assumed that the
Servlet policy model was just about constraints.

[#50503685_pgfId-22194]##link:jacc.htm#50503692_62140[See EJB
Pre-dispatch Decision] and link:jacc.htm#50503692_69497[See EJB
Application Embedded Privilege Test] were changed to reflect the removal
of the policy context identifier from permission names.

[#50503685_pgfId-22483]##A new link:jacc.htm#50503692_86918[See Setting
the Policy Context] was added to describe how a container must set the
policy context before invoking policy. This section also requires that
containers be granted the setPolicy permission in all policy contexts.

[#50503685_pgfId-22211]##A new link:jacc.htm#50503692_62534[See Policy
Context Handlers] was added to define the requirements on containers
with respect to policy context handlers. The following new sections were
added to define the policy context handlers required of containers:
link:jacc.htm#50503692_52376[See Container Subject Policy Context
Handler], link:jacc.htm#50503692_12572[See SOAPMessage Policy Context
Handler], link:jacc.htm#50503692_31680[See HttpServletRequest Policy
Context Handler], link:jacc.htm#50503692_93300[See EnterpriseBean Policy
Context Handler], and link:jacc.htm#50503692_37288[See EJB Arguments
Policy Context Handler].

[#50503685_pgfId-22234]##The methods for checking policy as defined in
link:jacc.htm#50503692_82799[See Checking AccessControlContext
Independent Grants] were reorganized such that it is clear that one of
the presented alternatives must be used. Using
AccessController.checkPermission was added as an additional supported
alternative, and the release specific techniques were annotated as such.
Also the techniques based on getPermissions were annotated as not
recommended. At the end of the section a requirement was made regarding
the policy context having been set prior to the evaluation.

[#50503685_pgfId-22237]##The same changes as described in the previous
change item were applied to link:jacc.htm#50503692_72233[See Checking
the Caller for a Permission].

[#50503685_pgfId-22241]##link:jacc.htm#50503692_42561[See Missing Policy
Contexts] was renamed from “Unconfigured Policy Contexts” and the
semantics were modified to reflect the use of the PolicyContext utility
class and the designation of the null policy context id as the default.

[#50503685_pgfId-22245]##A new link:jacc.htm#50503692_42943[See Default
Policy Context] was introduced to describe requirements for chaining
policy evaluation through to the provider of the default policy context.

======= [#50503685_pgfId-22129]##Changes to API

[#50503685_pgfId-22462]##Replaced the PolicyContext interface with the
PolicyContext class. Also changed all of the permissions such that none
of them implement the PolicyContext interface and such that none of them
include a policy context identifier in their names.

[#50503685_pgfId-22284]##Added the PolicyContextHandler interface.

[#50503685_pgfId-22286]##Removed the special purpose, EntityBean and
Argument array constructors from the EJBMethodPermission class.

[#50503685_pgfId-22287]##Removed the special purpose, EntityBean
constructor from the EJBRoleRefPermission class.

[#50503685_pgfId-22294]##Modified the actions field of the
EJBRoleRefPermission and WebRoleRefPermission classes such that they
contain at most a single role reference. Related to this change, also
removed the newPermissionCollection method implementation from both of
these classes.

[#50503685_pgfId-22285]##In the PolicyConfiguration interface, changed
the name of the getPolicyContextId method to getContextID.

[#50503685_pgfId-22295]##Changed the description of the
PolicyConfigurationFactory to require implementation classes to have a
public no argument constructor. Also precluded the use of the null value
as an argument to getPolicyConfiguration.

[#50503685_pgfId-22298]##Added a new constructor to the
WebResourcePermission and WebUserDataPermission classes to allow an
instance to be constructed from an HttpServletRequest.

======= [#50503685_pgfId-21865]##Changes to Issues

[#50503685_pgfId-22316]##Changed the introductory material to indicate
that all of the issues have been resolved.

[#50503685_pgfId-22310]##The resolution of Issue
link:jacc.htm#50503690_90798[See Configuration of Permissions with
Parameters], was changed to reflect the introduction of policy context
handlers.

[#50503685_pgfId-22323]##Issue link:jacc.htm#50503690_23668[See
Evolution of Deployment Policy Language], was partially resolved by
removing the requirement that permissions added via the
PolicyConfiguration interface have policy context identifiers in their
names.

[#50503685_pgfId-22336]##Issue link:jacc.htm#50503690_71245[See
Clarification of Servlet Constraint Matching Semantics], was resolved
with the rewrite of Section link:jacc.htm#50503692_37503[See
WebResourcePermission Matching Rules], and with the expectation that the
Servlet EG will adopt a change to section SRV.12.8 of the Servlet
specification.

[#50503685_pgfId-22344]##Issue link:jacc.htm#50503690_46288[See
References and Arguments in EJBMethodPermisison], was resolved with the
introduction of policy context handlers.

[#50503685_pgfId-22355]##Issue link:jacc.htm#50503690_65670[See
Integrating Principal-to-Role Mapping with the Deployer Console], was
made optional functionality.

[#50503685_pgfId-22359]##Issue link:jacc.htm#50503690_68166[See
PolicyContext Identifiers are Unknown to Components], was resolved by
introducing the PolicyContext utility class.

====== [#50503685_pgfId-22506]##Changes in Proposed Final Draft 1 Expert Draft 0.2

======= [#50503685_pgfId-22547]##Changes to the Preface and Overview

======= [#50503685_pgfId-22738]##Changes to Policy Configuration Subcontract

[#50503685_pgfId-22736]##In link:jacc.htm#50503688_18160[See What a Java
EE Platform’s Deployment Tools Must Do], the argument to
linkConfiguration was corrected in the example.

======= [#50503685_pgfId-22849]##Changes to Policy Decision Subcontract

[#50503685_pgfId-22766]##Section 4.2.2.1, “Servlet URL-Pattern Matching
Rules” was modified to indicate that pattern length only is significant
among path prefix matches.

[#50503685_pgfId-22767]##A description of the content of the tables and
how they should be interpreted was added to Section 4.2.2.2, “Servlet
Constraint Matching Examples”.

[#50503685_pgfId-22774]##Section 4.2.3, “WebRoleRefPermission Processing
Semantics” was added as the public draft mistakenly assumed that the
Servlet policy model was just about constraints.

[#50503685_pgfId-22780]##link:jacc.htm#50503692_62140[See EJB
Pre-dispatch Decision] and link:jacc.htm#50503692_47050[See Application
Embedded Privilege Test] were changed to reflect the removal of the
policy context identifier from permission names.

======= [#50503685_pgfId-22518]##Changes to History

[#50503685_pgfId-22526]##The history section was completed to reflect
the changes made in Version 0.1 and 0.2

======= [#50503685_pgfId-22564]##Changes to the Preface and Overview

[#50503685_pgfId-22533]##The requirement that applicable constraints be
selected by best-match was rephrased to define best-match as it is
defined in this spec and the Servlet specification.

======= [#50503685_pgfId-22585]##Changes to Policy Configuration Subcontract

[#50503685_pgfId-23027]##A clarifying sentence was added to the end of
link:jacc.htm#50503688_17252[See What the Provider Must Do] to make it
clear that this specification does not prescribe the policy language or
the methods used within providers to implement the defined policy and
role requirements.

======= [#50503685_pgfId-23052]##Changes to Policy Decision Subcontract

[#50503685_pgfId-23056]##Section 4.2.3, “WebRoleRefPermission Processing
Semantics” was simplified, as much of its content was not pertinent to
the WebRoleRefPermission class.

[#50503685_pgfId-22620]##Section 4.4.2, “EJB Permission Matching Rules”
was changed to reflect the change to a single role in the actions of the
EJBRoleRefPermission class.

[#50503685_pgfId-22666]##In link:jacc.htm#50503692_52376[See Container
Subject Policy Context Handler], the key for the "Subject Policy Context
Handler" was changed to javx.security.auth.Subject.container, and the
semantics were modified to return the caller or runAs identity as
appropriate.

[#50503685_pgfId-22664]##In link:jacc.htm#50503692_93300[See
EnterpriseBean Policy Context Handler], the handler return type was
corrected.

======= [#50503685_pgfId-22637]##Changes to API

[#50503685_pgfId-22635]##The resolution of the class diagram was
improved by changing to a black and white image.

====== [#50503685_pgfId-22877]##Changes in Proposed Final Draft 2 Expert Draft 1

======= [#50503685_pgfId-23312]##General

[#50503685_pgfId-23348]##In many places through out the document,
replaced used of the phrase “policy configuration” with “policy
context”, and adopted the practice of using PolicyConfiguration to refer
to the configuration interface of a policy context.

======= [#50503685_pgfId-23340]##Changes to Preface

[#50503685_pgfId-22938]##Updated Status section

[#50503685_pgfId-23327]##Acknowledged all contributors, including RI and
TCK team, and all those who commented on the specification.

======= [#50503685_pgfId-23310]##Changes to Overview

[#50503685_pgfId-23224]##Added dashed lines to
link:jacc.htm#50503681_80952[See Policy Configuration and Enforcement
Subcontracts]to represent PolicyContext interactions.

[#50503685_pgfId-23334]##Modified requirement 7, to reflect change is
treatment of permissions derived from security-constraints.

======= [#50503685_pgfId-23223]##Changes to Provider Configuration Subcontract

[#50503685_pgfId-22947]##Added two new sentences to the end of
link:jacc.htm#50503686_26492[See Policy Implementation Class], to make
it clear that this contract is dependent on the standard Java Policy
replacement mechanisms, and to make it clear that containers must
support replacability.

[#50503685_pgfId-23044]##In link:jacc.htm#50503686_43688[See What the
Application Server Must Do], added all elements of the jacc package to
the list of things that an application server must bundle.

[#50503685_pgfId-23354]##In link:jacc.htm#50503686_43688[See What the
Application Server Must Do], the requirement for
javax.security.auth.Policy replacement was softened such that it only
applies to 1.3 application servers that choose to support this
specification.

[#50503685_pgfId-23339]##In link:jacc.htm#50503686_43688[See What the
Application Server Must Do], reintroduced the requirement that setPolicy
not be called again, to ensure more than temporary Policy replacement.

======= [#50503685_pgfId-22993]##Changes to Policy Configuration Subcontract

[#50503685_pgfId-23002]##In the examples in
link:jacc.htm#50503688_18160[See What a Java EE Platform’s Deployment
Tools Must Do], the type of the declared permission was corrected to
agree with constructed type, and “petID” was changed to “petContextID”
(as a clarification).

[#50503685_pgfId-23379]##In the examples in
link:jacc.htm#50503688_18160[See What a Java EE Platform’s Deployment
Tools Must Do], a new stanza was added to place the policy context in
service.

[#50503685_pgfId-23402]##link:jacc.htm#50503688_64132[See Policy Context
Life Cycle], was added.

[#50503685_pgfId-23405]##In link:jacc.htm#50503688_24864[See Translating
Servlet Deployment Descriptors], the call to getPolicyConfiguration was
augmented with a second parameter to ensure that all policy statements
are removed from the context.

[#50503685_pgfId-23149]##link:jacc.htm#50503688_79610[See Translating
security-constraint Elements], was rewritten such that the target names
of the WebResourcePermission and WebUserDataPermission policy statements
resulting from the translation are qualified such that they precisely
specify the resources to which they apply. The most significant affect
of this change is that it captures the best-matching semantics of the
Servlet constraint model in the permission names, such that these
permissions can be tested using the standard J2SE permission evaluation
logic.

[#50503685_pgfId-23162]##Added a new section,
link:jacc.htm#50503688_58476[See Qualified URL Pattern Names]”, to
describe the rules for composing the target names used in the
construction of the WebResourcePermission and WebUserDataPermission
policy statements resulting from the translation of Servlet security
constraints.

[#50503685_pgfId-23183]##The section that had described the “Mapping to
Unacceptable Transport Connection Types” was changed to describe the
mapping to “acceptable” connection type. The title of the section was
changed to link:jacc.htm#50503688_68984[See Mapping Transport Guarantee
to Connection Type]”. link:jacc.htm#50503688_26240[See
transport-guarantee to Acceptable Connection Mapping] was also changed
to reflect the change to “acceptable” connection types, and the
connection type values in the table were modified to agree with the
transportTypeSpec syntax of the WebUserDataPermission class.

[#50503685_pgfId-23413]##link:jacc.htm#50503688_31590[See Servlet
URL-Pattern Matching Rules], was added to support the pattern
qualification section, and relevant sections of the enforcement
subcontract.

[#50503685_pgfId-23419]##link:jacc.htm#50503688_60464[See Example] was
added

[#50503685_pgfId-23424]##In link:jacc.htm#50503688_72413[See Translating
EJB Deployment Descriptors], the call to getPolicyConfiguration was
augmented with a second parameter to ensure that all policy statements
are removed from the context.

[#50503685_pgfId-23456]##The last paragraph of
link:jacc.htm#50503688_91617[See Translating the EJB exclude-list], was
clarified.

existing Policy Configuration], and link:jacc.htm#50503688_34361[See
Redeploying a Module], were all changed o reflect the introduction of
the policy context life cycle and the commit method.

[#50503685_pgfId-23461]##The inService method was added to the factory
methods called out in the first paragraph of
link:jacc.htm#50503688_58139[See Permission to Configure Policy], and
the SecurityPermission required by these methods was changed from
“getPolicy” to “setPolicy” to correct an inconsistency with the Java
implementation.

======= [#50503685_pgfId-23462]##Changes to Policy Decision and Enforcement Subcontract

[#50503685_pgfId-23296]##link:jacc.htm#50503692_58411[See Policy
Enforcement by Servlet Containers], was modified to require that
containers use Policy to make access control decisions.

[#50503685_pgfId-23497]##link:jacc.htm#50503692_73550[See Evaluation of
Transport Guarantees], was modified to describe how the transport type
value is obtained for the permission construction, and to reflect the
change made to the WebUserDataPermission class such that it is no longer
checked by “determining if a Permission has been excluded”.

[#50503685_pgfId-23501]##link:jacc.htm#50503692_73550[See Evaluation of
Transport Guarantees], and link:jacc.htm#50503692_64165[See Pre-dispatch

Servlet specification.

[#50503685_pgfId-23513]##link:jacc.htm#50503692_26066[See Servlet Policy
Decision Semantics], was rewritten to reflect the qualification of the
permission names, and the change to conventional permission evaluation
semantics.

[#50503685_pgfId-23517]##link:jacc.htm#50503692_37503[See
WebResourcePermission Matching Rules], link:jacc.htm#50503692_52056[See
WebRoleRefPermission Matching Rules], and
link:jacc.htm#50503692_36688[See WebUserDataPermission Matching Rules]
were added to define the permission specific matching semantics
necessary to support the policy decision semantics.

[#50503685_pgfId-23493]##Section 4.2.2.1, “Servlet URL-Pattern Matching
Rules”, Section 4.2.2.2, “Servlet Constraint Matching Examples”, and
Section 4.2.3, “WebRoleRefPermission Processing Semantics” were removed
from the document, as the change to qualified pattern names made these
sections unnecessary.

[#50503685_pgfId-23538]##link:jacc.htm#50503692_85170[See Policy
Enforcement by EJB Containers], was modified to require that containers
use Policy to make access control decisions.

[#50503685_pgfId-23067]##link:jacc.htm#50503692_74605[See EJB Policy
Decision Semantics], was replaced with a simplified section that
references link:jacc.htm#50503692_26066[See Servlet Policy Decision
Semantics].

[#50503685_pgfId-23554]##link:jacc.htm#50503692_14875[See
EJBMethodPermission Matching Rules], and
link:jacc.htm#50503692_73061[See EJBRoleRefPermission Matching Rules],
were added to define the permission specific matching semantics
necessary to support the policy decision semantics. These new sections
replaced Section 4.4.2, “EJB Permission Matching Rules”.

[#50503685_pgfId-23571]##The last paragraph of
link:jacc.htm#50503692_84924[See Component runAs Identity], was modified
to ensure that the AccessControlContext includes a
SubjectDomainCombiner.

[#50503685_pgfId-23579]##In link:jacc.htm#50503692_62534[See Policy
Context Handlers], changed the last sentence of the paragraph to “...if
these actions will cause the container to fail in its processing of the
associated request”.

[#50503685_pgfId-23059]##In link:jacc.htm#50503692_52376[See Container
Subject Policy Context Handler] replaced “caller’s identify” with
“caller’s identity”.

[#50503685_pgfId-23589]##In link:jacc.htm#50503692_12572[See SOAPMessage
Policy Context Handler], reduce to only EJB container, and added
additional qualification of the request coming in at the ServiceEndpoint
method interface.

[#50503685_pgfId-23593]##In link:jacc.htm#50503692_37288[See EJB
Arguments Policy Context Handler], clarified that this handler may not
be used if the request came in on the ServiceEndpoint method interface.
Also changed the return type when there are no arguments to an empty
array.

[#50503685_pgfId-23599]##Renamed section
link:jacc.htm#50503692_82799[See Checking AccessControlContext
Independent Grants] and changed it to reflect the changes made to
WebUserDataPermissions such that they are no longer “excluded”
permissions.

[#50503685_pgfId-23603]##In link:jacc.htm#50503692_42561[See Missing
Policy Contexts], changed replaced contains with inService method.

======= [#50503685_pgfId-22914]##Changes to API

[#50503685_pgfId-22912]##A new class diagram was imported to reflect the
changes to the API, most notably the introduction of the
PolicyContextException class.

[#50503685_pgfId-23612]##The javadocs were regenerated to conceal
implementation specific private instance variables.

[#50503685_pgfId-22933]##Added “ServiceEndpoint” to the list of

an Application or Module], changed the text of the footnote to properly
reflect that policy contexts are linked by object not by identifier.

======= [#50503685_pgfId-23885]##Changes to Policy Decision and Enforcement Subcontract

[#50503685_pgfId-23893]##In link:jacc.htm#50503692_73550[See Evaluation
of Transport Guarantees], and link:jacc.htm#50503692_64165[See
Pre-dispatch Decision], changed the corresponding construction
descriptions to be less prescriptive such that calling any constructor
that results in the proper name being established would be allowed. Also
indicated that the resulting url-pattern is to be “unqualified”.

[#50503685_pgfId-23924]##Modified link:jacc.htm#50503692_26066[See
Servlet Policy Decision Semantics], to require that the policy
statements of the default policy context be included in the access
decisions and to require that the subject based policy statements be
tested when the status is unresolved following the excluded and
unchecked evaluations.

[#50503685_pgfId-24070]##Added a new link:jacc.htm#50503692_61094[See
Matching Qualified URL Pattern Names] to describe URLPatternSpec
matching, and replaced the duplicate descriptions of this processing in
sections link:jacc.htm#50503692_37503[See WebResourcePermission Matching
Rules] and link:jacc.htm#50503692_36688[See WebUserDataPermission
Matching Rules] with a reference to this new section. Also modified the
description of the comparison to support symmetric implication as
necessary to support consistent semantics between the implies and equals
methods of these permissions.

[#50503685_pgfId-23900]##Added requirement that the comparisons defined

[#50503685_pgfId-23869]##comments on HttpServletRequest based
constructors for WebResourcePermission and WebUserDataPermission were
changed so as not to imply that this is the only constructor that may be
used by a container “prior to checking” a Servlet request.

[#50503685_pgfId-23962]##the description of the implies method of
WebResourcePermission and WebUserDataPermission was modified to support
the maxim that two permission objects p1 and p2 are equivalent iff
p1.implies(p2) and p2.implies(p1). To do so required handling the case
where the name of the argument permission (to implies) is a qualified
URLPatternSpec.

[#50503685_pgfId-23988]##the description of the servlet matching rules
in the implies method of WebResourcePermission and WebUserDataPermission
was corrected to account for universal matching by “/*”.

irrelevant by the presence of the “/*” pattern in the a
web-resource-collection within the deployment descriptor.

[#50503685_pgfId-24184]##Moved the last paragraph in
link:jacc.htm#50503688_58476[See Qualified URL Pattern Names]” to be its
first, and added a new paragraph to its end to describe irrelevant
patterns and their treatment by the permission constructors. Clarified
the syntax and description of URLPattern qualification. Indicated that
patterns qualified by other qualifying patterns may be dropped from the
list of qualifying patterns (and described why).

[#50503685_pgfId-24192]##In link:jacc.htm#50503688_60464[See Example],
removed the “/*” pattern from the first web-resource-collection of the
first security constraint, and made the corresponding changes to the
table of qualified URL pattern names and the table of constructed
permissions.

[#50503685_pgfId-24262]##Added a new column to
link:jacc.htm#50503688_37415[See Qualified URL Pattern Names from

canonical form of the qualified names.The description of
link:jacc.htm#50503688_98199[See Permissions and PolicyConfiguration
Operations from Example] was modified to indicate that the names in its
second column were obtained from the first column of

pattern of the URLPatternSpec, as otherwise the URLPatternSpec could not
imply itself which would violate the required equals semantics.

[#50503685_pgfId-24167]##The definition of the equals method of the

to act as a forward reference to optimization by reuse of
unauthenticated results as allowed for by new text added to
link:jacc.htm#50503692_33055[See Optimization of Permission

authorization checks on unprotected resources.

[#50503685_pgfId-24970]##Page 50: added new clarifying text to
link:jacc.htm#50503692_33055[See Optimization of Permission

evaluation results. In addition to reuse of equivalent evaluations,
added text to support reuse of unauthenticated evaluations to authorize
evaluations independent of caller identity. Described a common practice
that could be implemented by containers and providers, and that would
cause containers to be notified by providers of policy changes. By
following the suggested practice providers would be able to tell when
containers expect to be notified, for containers to determine if they
will be notified, and for containers to determine if their provider has
other properties necessary to sustain reuse.
