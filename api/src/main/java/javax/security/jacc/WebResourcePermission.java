     * a URLPatternSpec is as follows:
     *
     * <pre>
     *
     *          URLPatternList ::= URLPattern | URLPatternList colon URLPattern

     *
     * </pre>

     * A null URLPatternSpec is translated to the default URLPattern, "/", by the permission constructor. The empty string
     * is an exact URLPattern, and may occur anywhere in a URLPatternSpec that an exact URLPattern may occur. The first
     * URLPattern in a URLPatternSpec may be any of the pattern types, exact, path-prefix, extension, or default as defined
     * in the <i>Jakarta Servlet Specification)</i>. When a URLPatternSpec includes a URLPatternList, the patterns of the
     * URLPatternList identify the resources to which the permission does NOT apply and depend on the pattern type and value
     * of the first pattern as follows:
     *
     * <ul>
     * <li>No pattern may exist in the URLPatternList that matches the first pattern.
     * <li>If the first pattern is a path-prefix pattern, only exact patterns matched by the first pattern and path-prefix
     * patterns matched by, but different from, the first pattern may occur in the URLPatternList.
     * <li>If the first pattern is an extension pattern, only exact patterns that are matched by the first pattern and
     * path-prefix patterns may occur in the URLPatternList.
     * <li>If the first pattern is the default pattern, "/", any pattern except the default pattern may occur in the
     * URLPatternList.
     * <li>If the first pattern is an exact pattern a URLPatternList must not be present in the URLPatternSpec.
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>
     * The actions parameter contains a comma separated list of HTTP methods. The syntax of the actions parameter is defined
     * as follows:
     *
     * <pre>
     *
     *          ExtensionMethod ::= any token as defined by RFC 2616
     *                    (that is, 1*[any CHAR except CTLs or separators])
     *
     *          HTTPMethod ::= "GET" | "POST" | "PUT" | "DELETE" | "HEAD" |
     *                   "OPTIONS" | "TRACE" | ExtensionMethod
     *
     *          HTTPMethodList ::= HTTPMethod | HTTPMethodList comma HTTPMethod
     *
     *          HTTPMethodExceptionList ::= exclaimationPoint HTTPMethodList

     *                   HTTPMethodList
     *
     * </pre>
     *
     * <p>
     * If duplicates occur in the HTTPMethodSpec they must be eliminated by the permission constructor.
     *
     * <p>
     * A null or empty string HTTPMethodSpec indicates that the permission applies to all HTTP methods at the resources
     * identified by the URL pattern.
     *
     * <p>
     * If the HTTPMethodSpec contains an HTTPMethodExceptionList (i.e., it begins with an exclaimationPoint), the permission
